            <p>
                Drinking games are best when they’re about laughs and memories, not pressure.
                Keep water around, respect “no thanks,” and make sure everyone can get home safely.

            <h2>Why drinking game apps are so popular</h2>
            <p>
                The best drinking game apps solve the two biggest problems with party games: setup and flow.
                You don’t need a deck of cards, you don’t need a table, and you don’t need to explain rules for ten
                minutes. Open an app, pass the phone, and the game runs itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why phone-based drinking games are now the go-to for pregames, house parties, and friend
                hangouts. They’re fast, flexible, and easy to adapt to any group.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="photo-games">
            <h2>Photo-based games: the most memorable phone drinking games</h2>
            <p>
                The reason photo-based games are taking over is simple: you already have the content. The funniest
                photos, the worst photos, the “no way you have that” moments — they’re all in your camera roll.
                That’s why these games feel more personal than generic prompts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snapshotz is a photo-based party game built around this exact idea. It turns your camera roll into
                rounds like “guess whose photo,” “guess the location,” and “caption this.” It’s quick to set up and
                feels different every time you play, without having to come up with anything yourself.
            </p>
            <div class="cta">
                <p><strong>Want a zero-setup photo drinking game?</strong> Snapshotz turns your camera roll into the
                    game — perfect for pregames, friend nights, and after-parties.</p>

            <h2>Best types of drinking game apps</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than just listing random apps, here are the top categories that consistently win at parties.
                Pick the format that fits your group and the night you want.
            </p>

            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>1) Prompt-based party apps</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are the easiest to start. The app gives a prompt, you act it out, vote, or pass the phone.
                        They’re great for mixed groups because the rules are simple and you can play instantly.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> house parties, mixed friend groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> social / funny / low setup</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> quick to start, easy to explain</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>2) Card-free classics (phone versions)</h3>
                    <p>
                        These apps mimic the structure of classic drinking games but remove the setup. You still get
                        the familiar format, just faster.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> pregame, nostalgic game nights</li>
                        <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> classic / competitive</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> recognizable, quick rules</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>3) Team challenge apps</h3>
                    <p>
                        Quick rounds, team points, and a built-in sense of competition. These are the best drinking game
                        apps when you want loud energy and instant hype.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> large groups, party nights</li>
                        <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> competitive / loud</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> high energy, easy to keep score</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>4) Photo-based drinking games</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are the most personal and memorable. Instead of random prompts, the game pulls from your
                        camera roll so every round is a real memory.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best for:</strong> friend groups, pregames, smaller gatherings</li>
                        <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> funny / nostalgic / inside jokes</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> unique every time, built-in laughs</li>
                    </ul>

        <section id="how-to-choose">
            <h2>How to choose the right app for your group</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re not sure which drinking game app to pick, ask these three questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What’s the vibe?</strong> Chill hangout, loud party, or pregame energy?</li>
                <li><strong>How big is the group?</strong> Bigger groups need faster rotation and simple rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Do you want randomness or memories?</strong> Prompts are random, photo-based games are
                    personal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The best drinking game apps are the ones that keep people involved. If the game makes it easy to laugh,
                share, and pass the phone around, you’ve picked the right one.
            </p>

            <h2>Party-friendly, not pressure-heavy</h2>
            <p>
                A great drinking game app isn’t about pushing people to drink more — it’s about creating moments.
                Always keep water nearby, keep the rules light, and respect anyone who opts out.
